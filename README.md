# Music Visualiser Project

Name:Jason Glancy/ Tadhg Roche

Student Number: C22374581/c22348761

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
The objective of our project is to create an abstract visual story that interprets and reflects the essence of a chosen song using Processing and its associated sound libraries, such as Minim and the Processing Sound library. This initiative seeks to explore the convergence of music and visual art, where the audio's mood, rhythm, and tempo actively influence and drive the visual output. The final creation will be an immersive experience that allows the audience to perceive music through visual expressions, highlighting the synergy between auditory and visual sensory modalities.

# How it works
 



# What I am most proud of in the assignment
- Technical Integration: One of the major successes of the project was the effective integration of real-time audio processing with dynamic visual effects. We were able to implement complex audio analysis techniques such as FFT and amplitude detection to drive the visual elements, creating a synchronized and immersive experience that was highly responsive to the music.
- Abstract Artistic Expression: The project excelled in translating the emotional and thematic content of different songs into abstract visual narratives. Each song invoked a unique visual style and mood, from the gentle fall of rain and snow to the dramatic effects of thunderstorms and terrain changes, showcasing our ability to adapt visual responses to varied auditory inputs.
- Interactivity and Engagement: Enhancing user engagement through interactive elements was a key focus and success of the project. Users could manipulate visual elements through a GUI and explore the 3D visual space with camera controls, making the experience more engaging and personalized.
- Collaborative Development: The project was a testament to effective teamwork and collaboration. Using GitHub for version control and project management, we maintained a cohesive development process, where each team memberâ€™s contributions were clearly documented and integrated seamlessly.
